AI Trading Bot - Project Overview


📌 Project Description

This AI Trading Bot is a hybrid trading system that combines Technical Analysis (TA), Machine Learning (ML), Sentiment Analysis, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to predict profitable trades in the forex and cryptocurrency markets. The bot uses data scraping, predictive modeling, and trade execution automation to maximize returns.

🔗 How Files Work Together & Integrations

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

data_scraper.py → Collects real-time & historical market data from APIs (e.g., Binance, Forex APIs) and stores it in data/historical_data.csv.

preprocess_data.py → Cleans and normalizes data for ML models.


🔗 Integration: Data from data_scraper.py is processed by preprocess_data.py and stored for ML training.


---

2️⃣ Feature Engineering & Sentiment Analysis

feature_engineering.py → Extracts trading indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands) & adds new AI-based indicators.

train_sentiment.py → Uses LLM API (GPT-4, Claude) to analyze social media/news sentiment and saves it in sentiment_data.csv.


🔗 Integration:

train_sentiment.py calls an LLM API to classify sentiment.

feature_engineering.py combines technical indicators + sentiment scores for ML models.



---

3️⃣ Training AI Models (ML & RL)

train_lstm.py → Trains an LSTM model (models/lstm_model.h5) on historical price data.

train_xgboost.py → Trains an XGBoost model (models/xgboost_model.pkl) for price movement prediction.

train_rl.py → Trains an RL agent (models/rl_agent.pth) to optimize trading actions.


🔗 Integration:

ML models are trained using processed data.

Sentiment scores and technical indicators improve model accuracy.



---

4️⃣ Trade Execution & Justification

execute_trade.py → Places trades based on model predictions.

execute_trade.py also calls an LLM API to explain the reason behind each trade.


🔗 Integration:

Predictions from models/ guide trade execution.

LLM API provides a human-readable explanation for trade decisions.



---

5️⃣ Backtesting & Strategy Optimization

backtest.py → Tests models on historical data to validate profitability.

Uses results to adjust hyperparameters in ML training scripts.


🔗 Integration:

Backtesting results improve ML & RL models before deployment.



---

6️⃣ Main Controller & Configuration

main.py → Orchestrates the entire workflow:

1. Fetches data (data_scraper.py).


2. Prepares data (preprocess_data.py).


3. Loads trained models (models/).


4. Predicts trade signals.


5. Places trades (execute_trade.py).


6. Logs performance (logs/).



config/config.yaml → Stores API keys, trading parameters, and model settings.


🔗 Integration:

main.py connects all components for end-to-end execution.
